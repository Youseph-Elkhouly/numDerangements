# numDerangements
This code defines numDerangements(n), a recursive function that calculates the number of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position) for n items. The base cases handle n = 0 and n = 1, and the recursive case calculates derangements for larger n. The main() function tests the solution with predefined test cases.
